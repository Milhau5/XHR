<h2>A Man and a Maid</h2>
<p>NURSERY RHYME</p>
<p>There was a little man,<br>
Who wooed a little maid,<br>
And he said, "Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?<br>
I have little more to say,<br>
So will you, yea or nay,<br>
For least said is soonest mended-ded, ded, ded."</p>

<p>The little maid replied,<br>
"Should I be your little bride,<br>
Pray what must we have for to eat, eat, eat?<br>
Will the flame that you're so rich in<br>
Light a fire in the kitchen?<br>
Or the little god of love turn the spit, spit, spit?"</p>
